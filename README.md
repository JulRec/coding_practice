__passingMark__  
In schools in the country known as Codelandia, a special five-point grading scale is used.
Each grade is a English letter from 'A' to 'E' with a value from 5 to 1 respectively.
A student is considered to have passed the class if the average value of their grades is greater than or equal to the passing mark.
Given the passing mark and a student's grades, find out if they have successfully passed the class or not.
  
    
__powersOfTwo__
